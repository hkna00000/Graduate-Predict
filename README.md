# Graduate-Predict
Predicting student graduate potential of the University of Information Technology
## Problem Introduction
Currently, information technology is developing rapidly and is being widely applied in most fields, contributing to a vibrant Fourth Industrial Revolution. In the field of education, many schools and centers have adopted information technology to digitize their teaching processes to deliver knowledge to everyone more quickly and conveniently. After the major outbreak of the pandemic at the end of 2019, this digitization process was further accelerated through online learning. This means that over time, the amount of educational data stored in schools has increased significantly. If this data is scientifically processed, analyzed, and mined, it will greatly contribute to supporting students' learning and adjusting teachers' teaching methods. Therefore, the field of educational data analysis and mining has been attracting a lot of attention. Many of the pressing issues in education in the past have been resolved by computers thanks to data mining technologies in particular and data science in general.

Recently, at some post-secondary institutions such as universities and colleges, the credit-based system is being implemented. This system allows students to be more proactive in choosing their study schedules. Within this credit-based system, students can freely choose to register for many courses if they feel capable and have the time to absorb all the registered subjects. Conversely, they can register for fewer courses if they feel unable to absorb many subjects or cannot dedicate much time to studying multiple subjects. However, in practice, students often feel confused when choosing courses due to the large number of subjects offered each semester. In such cases, in addition to self-research, students need the assistance of academic advisors and the school's teaching staff to provide thorough guidance and resolve the situation. Therefore, teachers need to review each student's academic results, understand their needs, and offer early warnings and advice. For a university with thousands of students, this task is not easy to implement. Consequently, this project aims to explore educational data and then use the findings to develop software to support educational work.
## Objectives
- Research Topic Objectives: Based on the graduation data of previous cohorts, predict the graduation likelihood (not graduated/graduated) of students at the University of Information Technology – Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City.
- Research Purpose: Identify the factors affecting the graduation likelihood of students at the University of Information Technology – Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City, to provide insights and effective study methods for future cohorts.
## Object and Study range
### Research topic data is limited to the University of Information Technology - Ho Chi Minh City National University including:

- Pre-admission Data of Students: Entrance exam results (national high school exam scores, competency assessment scores, academic transcript evaluation scores); Information on students admitted through direct admissions or priority admissions; Personal information of students; Certifications and achievements of students (if any);
- In Progress Academic Data Set: Scores of subjects taken each semester, year by year; Semester-by-semester conduct scores; Certifications earned during their studies; Academic disciplinary actions and academic leaves of absence
